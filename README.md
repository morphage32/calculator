Browser Calculator Project

This project demonstrates basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript capabilities all in one project. This project is intended to be a functioning tool to calculate mathematical expressions just as a real pocket calculator would. All of the input from the user should be through buttons on the page, rather than prompt windows as seen in previous projects.
